### Motivation

Freenode’s #DN is a channel for software designers. Unfortunately, most designers find all the effort in setting up and using IRC off putting. Ideally there would be a client that requires them to simply click **one button** to get chatting. Bonus points if it looks good.


### Deploying

**Before you start** please note that a lot is currently hardcoded for #DN specifically.

Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then clone this repo and run `npm install`.
